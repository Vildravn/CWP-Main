  concept_unclos1: "UNCLOS I"
  concept_unclos1_desc: "UNCLOS I was the first attempt to create an international treaty that would provide a comprehensive legal framework for the use and management of the world's oceans and coastal areas. Prior to its proposal, there was no universally accepted set of rules to govern the use of the seas, which resulted in conflicts between nations over issues such as territorial boundaries, fishing rights, and the exploitation of marine resources.\nThe need for a more cohesive legal framework was recognized by many nations, as well as by scientists, environmentalists, and other stakeholders. UNCLOS I was intended to promote cooperation among nations, encourage the sustainable use of marine resources, and ensure that all stakeholders had a voice in the management of the seas.\nThe resolution was the result of extensive discussions and negotiations among a diverse group of stakeholders, including representatives from government, industry, and scientific communities. The goal was to develop a legal framework that would be widely accepted and enforced by all nations with access to the oceans. The UNCLOS I resolution provided a foundation for subsequent efforts to refine and expand upon the legal framework for ocean governance."
